Simple example of compiling and calling Go code from ruby

compile_locally.sh compiles a mylib.so file using local go

compile_with_docker_for_linux.sh pulls a docker image with go preinstalled and compiles the module using it to get a linux architecture module from osx for example

once module is compiled you can run script.rb to test it
